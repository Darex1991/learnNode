## HINTS
  To make a Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and
  start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the node
  command. e.g.:

```$ node program.js```

You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:

   ```console.log("text")```

When you are done, you must run:

   ```$ learnyounode verify program.js```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and
the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
